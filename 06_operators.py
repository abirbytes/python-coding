# Arithmetic Operators
a=7
b=4
c=a+b
print(c)

#Assingment Operators
a = 4-2 # Assing 4-2 in a
print(a)
b = 6
# b +=3 #Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to  b
b -=3 #Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)

#Comparison Operators
# d = 5>4
d= 5==4 # use double equal to chck if numbers are equal to each other and to assign value in a variable use one equal sign.....
print(d)
#Logical Operators
e= True or False# In case of or oif one of them is true it will return true, e.g. Human or Fish , True cause you might be human but if it is a fish or fish its false cause you can't be fish [One atleast true]
print (e)
f = True and False # It cant be true and false together so there should be True and true to get an output of True otherwise it is false [Both true required]
print(f)
print(not(True)) # Turns the true to false and false to true,, basically reversing the thing....
