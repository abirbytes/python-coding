'''expression = not true and false or true
according to operating precedance,, not true = false
therefore, expression = False and False or true and the "and" operator says if any of the value is false then the whole thing will be false... Therefore, expression = False or True, and the 'or" operator says if any value is true then the whole expression will be true. Thus, the output if the expression is evaluated will be True.'''
