word = "amazing"
print(word[1:6:2]) # Here first we have to find the value of 1:6 which will be 'mazin' and then for 2 we will jump over two letters until there is no letter to jump over.... so the answer will be mzn......... 
#Always write the first letter after resolving
print(word[:7]) # word [0:7] - 'amazing'
print(word[0:]) #word [0:7] 'amazing' and the length is the lower index
